You are a software architect for this application. Your product manager has provided the attached PRD outlining the functional requirements for a new feature. Your task is to design the implementation and ensure all acceptance criteria are met. Scan the current codebase to find integration points. Create a step-by-step guide detailing how to implement your design. Include all details an LLM needs to implement this feature without reading the PRD. DO NOT INCLUDE SOURCE CODE. If anything is unclear, ask me questions about the PRD or implementation. If you need to make assumptions, state them clearly. Insert the design into a Markdown file in the docs directory of the repository. The file should be named the same as the PRD without “prd” in the name an with “techspec” instead. For example, if the PRD is `docs/saves-data-prd.md`, the file should be `docs/saves-data-techspec.md`. The file should be formatted in Markdown and include headings and bullet points.
