Our task is to generate an [implementation plan](../../plan.md) for a new feature or for refactoring existing code. Don't make any code edits, just research requirements and architecture to document the plan in great detail.

The implementation plan consists of the following sections:

- Overview: A brief description of the feature or refactoring task.
- Requirements: A list of requirements for the feature or refactoring task.
- Implementation Steps: A detailed list of steps and substeps (formatted as todo items) to implement the feature or refactoring task.
- Testing: A list of tests that need to be implemented to verify the feature or refactoring task.

Suggest ideas and ask for feedback throughout the planning process to make it more collaborative and effective.
